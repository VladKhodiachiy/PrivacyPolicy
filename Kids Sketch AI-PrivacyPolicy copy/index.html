From there, it is securely sent via API to AI services Open AI where the image is transformed based on your selected style.

 	<li>Credits used to generate images are non-refundable and will be deducted even if the final result is not accessed within the 48-hour window.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We do not sell, rent, share, or transfer your uploaded drawings or generated results to any third parties, including advertisers, data brokers, or analytics platforms. We also do not use your images for training or improving any AI models.</p>
	<p><strong>Can backend services change over time?</strong><br>
	Yes, the infrastructure or third-party services we use may change in the future. Any such changes will be transparently updated in this Privacy Policy.</p>
