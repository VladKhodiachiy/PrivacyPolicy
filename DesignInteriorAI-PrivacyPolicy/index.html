   <h2>5. DO WE COLLECT FACE DATA?</h2>
<p><strong>In Short:</strong> No. We do not collect, store, sell, or use face data — even if a face happens to appear in a room photo you upload.</p>

<p>Our app is designed to work with <strong>room photos only</strong>. When you upload a photo to generate a new interior design, the following process occurs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your photo is securely uploaded to our backend servers (currently hosted on Google Cloud Platform, USA).</li>
  <li>The photo is sent via API to our AI service provider’s servers, where it is processed and transformed into a new interior design image.</li>
  <li>During this process, your original photo is temporarily stored only as needed to complete the transformation.</li>
  <li>Once the design image has been generated, your original photo — including any face data that may have appeared in the room photo — is permanently deleted from both Google Cloud Platform and the AI service provider’s servers.</li>
  <li>The resulting design image is stored on our server for up to 48 hours so you can view and download it. After 48 hours, it is automatically and permanently deleted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that any credits used for generation are non-refundable, regardless of whether the final image is accessed before deletion.</p>

<p>We do not share, sell, or transfer your photos or any face data that may appear in them to third parties (including advertisers, analytics providers, data brokers, or AI training services). Your photos are never used to train artificial intelligence models.</p>

<p>We may update or change our backend server providers in the future. If this happens, we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly.</p>

We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy policy. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services or applications that may be linked to or from the Apps. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.</p>

</ul>

You should only access the services within a secure environment.</p>
  
  
    <h2>9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>

    <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 13 years of age.

    <h2>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.</p>
